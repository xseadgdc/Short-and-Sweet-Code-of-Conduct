# The Short &amp; Sweet Code of Conduct
Even yet another code of conduct without the DEI stuff. 

## Q&amp;A

### Q: Cool project! How do I add this to my own?
A: Just copy and paste the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file into your repository. Simple as that.

### Q: Since there is no DEI, is this CoC still discriminatory?
No! And it was never written to be.

### Q: I was just discriminated by someone. What do I do?
A: Take it to the head of the project; this is a clear violation of this CoC.

### Q: Are off-topic discussions allowed?
A: They are generally discouraged, but not written to be censor-happy about it.
