# The Short & Sweet Code of Conduct

We are all adults, capable of having adult discussions.

Participants must accept anyone's contributions, be tolerant of opposing views, and not care whether another is liberal or conservative, black or white, straight or gay, or anything in between. Participants shouldn't bring it up, or ask. We, as contributers, simply do not care to know.

Participants must ensure that his/her language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks (i.e., the promoting of physical harm of someone you disagree with should be avoided).

Participants should simply treat others how he/she wants to be treated. Participants should also avoid plagiarizing others' work and lie about any misconduct, false or otherwise, with another.

When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.

Behavior which can be reasonably considered against these terms will not be tolerated.

Beyond that, nothing else matters.
